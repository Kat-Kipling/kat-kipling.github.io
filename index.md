# Hi. I'm Kat.
I am a backend developer based in Belfast. I mainly use C#, Python and SQL to build server-side solutions, or properity software. I'm currently expanding my frontend skills, solidfying my HTML5+CSS+JS knowledge, along with also learning technologies such as Angular to build SPAs.

I am currently working at Cirdan, doing data engineering. I worked on a reporting database proof-of-concept built from data from a pre-existing system. I worked mainly on building the database itself, but also helped with the main ETL process.

In my free time, I like to play music (I play guitar and bass), play video games such as Valorant or Helldivers, and spend time with my friends.
